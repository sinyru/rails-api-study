# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
The responsibilities of the model layer is to look into the database and response back to the controller layer.
```

## Define Controller Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The responsibilities of the controller layer is to make requests to the model layer and respond back to the server.
```

## Define Router Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The router is like the path/messenger in Rails. It interacts with the controller and the client.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
1. Client sends requests to server
2. Server sends requests to controller
3. Controller sends requests to model, parse requests into JSON
4. Model looks into database
5. Model sends response back to Controller
6. Controller send response back to Server, parse responds into JSON
7. Server sends response back to Client.
```
